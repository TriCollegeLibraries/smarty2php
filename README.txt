Smarty2PHP.py

This will convert much of the stuff in a smarty template to PHP. Not everything but enough to be a big help in a conversion.

This is a pyython script that was tested wth pythonwin and the win32 extensions on a windows xp machine (should be fine on vista too). You need to install python with the win32 extensions on your pc to use this program. It can be made to work on linux or a mac by changing the file open stuff at the beginning of the script
